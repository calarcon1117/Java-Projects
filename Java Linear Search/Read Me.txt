Asssignment:

To implement the Linear Search algorithm. Your Java program will ask the user to input 10 letters (e.g., e, c, z, x, k, m, o, a, d, f) and your program stores these ten letters into array. Then you will ask the user what letter the user wants to search. If the letter is in the array, your program should return the position of the letter in the array. If the array does not have this letter, a message “Letter is not found” should display.
